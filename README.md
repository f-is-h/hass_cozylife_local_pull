## üöÄ Easy Installation

### Method 1: Direct Clone (Recommended)
```bash
cd /config/custom_components/
git clone https://github.com/f-is-h/hass_cozylife_local_pull.git
```
**That's it!** No extra steps needed. 

### Method 2: Manual Download
1. Download: https://github.com/f-is-h/hass_cozylife_local_pull/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
2. Extract to `/config/custom_components/hass_cozylife_local_pull/`

## Configuration

Add to your `configuration.yaml`:
```yaml
hass_cozylife_local_pull:
  lang: en
  ip:
    - "192.168.1.99"
    - "192.168.1.100"
```

## After Installation

1. **Restart Home Assistant**
2. Your devices should appear automatically
3. No more errors in logs!

## üÜö Differences from Original Repository

### Repository Structure
**Original Issue:** The original repository had a nested structure that caused installation problems:
```
repo/custom_components/hass_cozylife_local_pull/  ‚Üê Files here
```
When cloned to `/config/custom_components/`, this created:
```
/config/custom_components/hass_cozylife_local_pull/custom_components/hass_cozylife_local_pull/
```
Home Assistant couldn't find the integration due to the extra nesting.

**Our Solution:** Component files are now directly in the root directory:
```
repo/  ‚Üê Files directly here
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ light.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ switch.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```
This follows Home Assistant community standards and enables "clone and use" installation.

### Installation Comparison

| Original Repository | Our Fixed Repository |
|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
| ‚ùå Clone ‚Üí Manual file moving | ‚úÖ Clone ‚Üí Ready to use |
| ‚ùå Confusing nested paths | ‚úÖ Standard structure |
| ‚ùå Easy to mess up | ‚úÖ Foolproof installation |

## Changes from Original

### Fixed Issues:
- ‚úÖ `'HomeAssistant' object has no attribute 'helpers'` error
- ‚úÖ Deprecated `hass.helpers.discovery.load_platform` usage
- ‚úÖ Synchronous setup functions replaced with async versions
- ‚úÖ Improved platform loading mechanism
- ‚úÖ Better error handling and logging
- ‚úÖ Installation path confusion resolved

### Technical Improvements:

- Updated manifest.json with proper metadata
- Cleaner code structure following Home Assistant guidelines
- Better type hints and documentation
- Repository structure optimized for easy installation

## Compatibility

- **Home Assistant:** 2025.5+
- **Python:** 3.11+
- **Backward compatible** with earlier HA versions

## Troubleshooting

### If you have the old version installed:
```bash
cd /config/custom_components/
rm -rf hass_cozylife_local_pull/
git clone https://github.com/f-is-h/hass_cozylife_local_pull.git
```

### Common issues:
- **No devices appear**: Check that devices are on the same network and ports 5555 (TCP) and 6095 (UDP) are not blocked
- **"Integration not found"**: Ensure files are in `/config/custom_components/hass_cozylife_local_pull/` (not nested)
- **Old errors persist**: Restart Home Assistant after installation

## Development & Testing

For developers and advanced users:

### Test Network Connectivity
```bash
cd /config/custom_components/hass_cozylife_local_pull/
python3 test_discovery.py
```

### Enable Debug Logging
Add to `configuration.yaml`:
```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.hass_cozylife_local_pull: debug
```
